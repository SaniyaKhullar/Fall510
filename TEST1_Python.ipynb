    "    Please note that for xy coordinates in the positive ++ quadrant (quadrant 1), Green's Theorem returns Positive area ONLY if the vertices are numbered clockwise around the perimeter.  That is, sketching the polygon should be done in a clockwise way. \n",
    "    If it is done in a counter-clockwise ordering sketch, then the computed area will be negative. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example:\n",
    "    polygarea([(2, 2), (3,2), (2,1)]) yields a negative area: -1\n",
    "    polygarea([(3, 2), (2,2), (2,1)]) yields a positive area: 1\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    In both cases, the set of points are the same.  However the computed area is different based on the order. Please note that here, for this function, Saniya (based upon Professor Pilcher's formula) is using the absolute value, so that no matter what the area returned will ALWAYS be positive :).  No need to worry about clockwise or counterclockwise here...please order polygon sides as ye like, but in consecutive edge order:)\n",

    "     Please note that the coordinates should be entered in the order in which the polygon should be created.  All coordinates should be unique.  The first set of coordinates essentially becomes interpreted as the last set of coordinates as well since the figure needs to close. \n",
    "     Therefore, for these coordinates: (0, 0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2), the program will go from: (0,0) to (2,0) to (2,2) to (0,2), and finally back to (0,0).\n",

    "     polygarea([(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3),...(xn,yn)]).\n",
    "     That is for example the 2 by 2 square formed by these points: (0, 0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2) will have an area of: (2)(2)= 4 units squared.\n",

    "        All edges are straight lines. \n",

    "     of this square with these coordinates:  (0, 0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2). \n",
    "     Please note that the coordinates should be entered in the order in which the polygon should be created.  All coordinates should be unique.  The first set of coordinates essentially becomes interpreted as the last set of coordinates as well since the figure needs to close. \n",
    "     Therefore, for these coordinates: (0, 0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2), the program will go from: (0,0) to (2,0) to (2,2) to (0,2), and finally back to (0,0).\n",

    "     Please note that when entering the coordinates in the polygperim() function, please enter them in this form:\n",
    "     polygperim([(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3),...(xn,yn)]).\n",
    "     That is for example the 2 by 2 square formed by these points: (0, 0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2) will have a total perimeter of: (2) + (2) + (2) + (2) = 8 units.\n",
    "    Hence, the function: polygperim([(0, 0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2)]) should yield an 8.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The distance between the sets of coordinates is calculated using the distance formula:  distance = squareroot(((x2-x1)^(2)) + ((y2-y1)^(2)))\n",
